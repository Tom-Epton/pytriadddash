**Salary distribution and projections**

This dashboard visualises salary data from a range of data scientists surveryed between 2020 and 2024.
The second plot shows the salaries of senior engineers and a projection of where these salaries will go.
Use this tool to identify trends, peak ranges, and the overall distribution of salaries. The plots are fully 
interactive, you can zoom in on specific salary bands for example. 

Your company could gain insights from data products such as this, drop us an email [here](mailto:hello@pytridata.com).

Below is a preview of the dataset, showcasing the first five rows. Each row represents a record with multiple columns, providing insights into different attributes captured in this data. This particular data was from a global 
survey of datascientists with various conditions imposed for inclusion. You can find out more on Kaggle regarding the data used if you wish.

The following plot is the salaries of the senior engineers pulled from the broader 
data set visualised above. We've plotted the mean salary for each year in the dataset 
and used an augmented autoregression model to forecast the next 3 years. We also used the same model to predict 2024's salary from the data of 2020 to 2023 so you 
can get an idea of how close the forecasted value got to the real salary data from 2024. To 
predict 2025 and 2026 the real 2024 value was used.'
